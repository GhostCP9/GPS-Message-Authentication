Cyptographic Message Authentication for GPS Civilian Signal Transmission

1. Implemented TESLA algorithm for symmetric message authentication to improve the security and interity of GPS L1C signal Transmission.
2. Improved TESLA algorithm by introducing an additional certification process for each GNSS satelliteâ€™s public key by a trusted third-party, which addressed its vulnerability of managing public keys on the receiver devices.
